title: "Preassignment: Days 1 and 2"
---

This is a **long** preassignment that involves lots of software installation and testing. Please leave a total of at least **2 hours** to complete this preassignment. That may seem like a long time, but once you've done it you'll have a powerful suite of software that you can use through your career at MIT and beyond. 

# 1. Version Control: Git and GitHub

git is a powerful system for collaborating on and publishing software. It is standard in the worlds of data science and software development. Learning to use git will help you manage your own work; collaborate with colleagues; and access useful tools. 

## Install git

Get started by installing git. You can follow the relevant instructions for your operating system [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). For Windows 10 users, we suggest installing and interacting with git either via the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) or via the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com).

## Make an Account on GitHub.com

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a hosting service for git that makes it easy to share your code. 

1. Sign up for an account -- remember to keep track of your username and password. 
2. Link your GitHub.com credentials to your local git installation.  

## Test Your Installation

INSERT TEST

# 2. Data Analysis: R and RStudio

## Install R and RStudio

**We are assuming that you have recent versions of R and RStudio installed.** In particular, you need R version 3.5.1 and RStudio 1.1.456. For this reason, we **strongly recommend** that you download and install both R and RStudio, even if both are already on your laptop. 
 
1. **Install R**: Navigate to [`https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/`](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/) and follow the instructions for your operating system. 
2. **Download RStudio**: Navigate to [`https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and download RStudio Desktop with an Open Source License. 
3. **Test Your Installation**: Open RStudio and type 1+2 into the Console window, and press "Enter." If you see the expected result, you are ready to move on. 

## Install Packages

In the RStudio console, type 
```{r}
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'knitr', 'flexdashboard', 'glmnet', 'ROCR', 'nycflights13', 'caToools', 'quantreg'))
```

If you encounter any error messages that you are unable to handle, please email Phil at `pchodrow@mit.edu`. 

## Test Packages

[Download](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/data_science_intro/preassignment/preassignment1.Rmd) and open the file `preassignment1.rmd` in RStudio. Click the "Knit" button at the top of the source editor, or press `cmd + shift + k` (`ctrl + shift + k` on Windows). The "Knit" button is the one circled in [this image](http://cinf401.artifice.cc/images/workflow-25.png).

After a few moments, RStudio should pop up with a new window containing a dashboard that looks like [this](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/data_science_intro/preassignment/preassignment1.html).  If your dashboard matches the example, move on to the next step. If not, please email Phil (`pchodrow@mit.edu`) with the error message you received. 


# 3. Optimization: Julia and JuMP
