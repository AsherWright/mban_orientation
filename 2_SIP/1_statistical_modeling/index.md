# Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning in R

In this three-hour workshop, we will introduce workflows in R for performing elementary statistical modeling and machine learning. Throughout, we will emphasize tidy workflows that are easy to write, easy to read, and easy to reproduce. 

Topics covered include: 

- Feature engineering, including some elementary sentiment analysis. 
- Data splits: training, testing, and validation. 
- Training models: linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, and k-means clustering. 
- Tidily extracting, evaluating, and visualizing model performance.
