# Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning in R

In this three-hour workshop, we will introduce workflows in R for performing elementary statistical modeling and machine learning. Throughout, we will emphasize tidy workflows that are easy to write, easy to read, and easy to reproduce. 

Topics covered include: 

- Feature engineering, including some basic text analysis. 
- Data splits: training, testing, and validation. 
- Training models: linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, and k-means clustering. 
- Tidily extracting and visualizing model predictions. 

## Preassignment

Prior to the session, you may find it helpful to review your scripts from back in August, as we will be relying heavily on the tools we introduced then, including all our data wrangling and visualization functions. 

Prior to the session, please run the following commands in R Studio.

```{r}
install.packages(c('tidytext', 'randomForest'))
```
